I was in two minds about whether to put these on a public GH page or not. However, solutions for the 2022 challenge are already widely reported. Nevertheless, I’ve refrained from putting up descriptions of the individual challenges or commenting the code beyond what was there at the time the script went for verification. If I’ve used a code snippet or been inspired by a blog I have however marked this in the comments.

These scripts represent my unpolished solutions, as they were at the time they passed verification. They are not guaranteed to be elegant, efficient, or to generalize to any cases beyond the open and hidden test cases presented in the challenge. They’re really just my mementos of obscene, but incredibly fun 4am caffeine fuelled coding benders that went into beating the challenge.

You are of course free to use any of these as you see fit, if you can make sense of them. However, I will say that simply pasting them into foobar will deprive you of an amazingly fun coding and learning experience which at its core is what foobar is all about.
